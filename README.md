# The impact of redundancy on map user perception. Comparison of the usefulness of a map presented alone and together with other forms of data presentation.

## Master's thesis conducted at the Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies, University of Warsaw

### Abstract

Within the framework of the present work, a study was carried out of the effect of redundancy of information presented by means of various forms of data presentation on the perception of the map user, studied by usability indicators: correctness, response time and task difficulty rating. Particular attention was paid to the process of using the map, whose stand-alone presentation and co-presentation with graph, table and text were compared in the experiment. Separate analysis was also made of the relationships between the four forms of presentation mentioned above occurring together. The study in the within-group scheme was conducted using eye tracking to obtain data on when and where the subjects' gaze was focused. In addition, data on the personal characteristics and predispositions of the participants were obtained using a questionnaire. At the stage preceding the empirical study, the history of the development of the eye tracking method was presented, the operation of the modern eye tracker was described, and the applications of the method in various fields of science and business were introduced, with particular emphasis on the research carried out in the field of mapping utility and redundancy. The processes of planning, preparation, conducting the study in the present work and the tools and software used (ArcMap, Corel Draw, Tobi Pro Lab, Python programming language) are characterized. The results obtained are presented descriptively and graphically, and the full results of each analysis are included as appendices. Conclusions from the performed experiment are formulated, and a discussion of the obtained results is carried out in the context of previous research conducted in this area.
